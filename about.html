                Background Bhagwan Mahaveer Bal Sanskar Kendra was started under the guidance of Lt. Shri Magan Lal
                Goyal with just 60 Students.
                At that time there were only three schools in the Tikamgarh with Hindi as a medium of instruction. There
                were many challenges before a young inexperienced management team of the school.
                But, with the passes of time, encouragement and support of the parents, the students and the staff, the
                missionary sprit of the young team at the helm of affairs of the institution, prevailed.
                The school strength grew over the years. From a humble beginning in year 1983 with just 60 student,
                today it boasts to 1000+ students in all the classes. We owe our progress to the patronage extended to
                us by the parents of our students.
                We have been conscious of the trust reposed in us by them to impart quality education to their wards.
                We are also grateful for the co-operation extended to us by them to fulfill our tasks and meet our
                commitments towards our students.

                A school is a place entangling learning and joy, combining knowledge and lessons of life for an enriched
                tomorrowâ€¦.. Education must aim on aspects, which contribute to the development of the young minds as
                they step into the contemporary world. Our endeavour has been to establish an atmosphere that fosters
                creativity and inculcate the spirit of learning in young exploring step-ins. We are here for not only
                monitoring the students but to inculcate in the impressible minds the priceless ethics of dignity,
                honesty, compassion, fraternity, and patriotism. Ever since its inception in 1983 , BMBKS IS A TYPE Of

                capacity among our children to allow them to carve their own niche in the world of future. Our motto is
                to provide a genre by giving the environment where the children can blossom with their utmost potential,
                knowledge and inquisition in the most magnificent & creative way. We at Step Up School are confident
